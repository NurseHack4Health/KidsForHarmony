# KidsForHarmony
One in 3 of the people reading this team description will know someone who has died by suicide in their lifetime. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in kids and youth aged 10-24 years old. Based on the most recent Youth Risk Behaviors Survey from 2017, 7.4 percent of youth in grades 9-12 reported that they had made at least one suicide attempt in the past 12 months and the rate of suicide among those aged 10 to 24 increased nearly 60% between 2007 and 2018, according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. GUYS! THIS WAS PRE-PANDEMIC! With one of our most vulnerable populations facing a pandemic, closed schools, social isolation, and parents not at home this number is expected to grow exponentially. This group will be developing an app "Harmony", which will provide age appropriate education to help manage living through Covid and the impending epidemic of suicide by 1) improve resiliency 2) provide tools to stay connected 3)provide things such as meditation for kids etc, 4)and connect them to resources to help a friend/family member of themselves (suicide prevention hotline, texline, peer mentoring etc).
